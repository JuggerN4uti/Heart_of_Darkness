# Heart_of_Darkness
 A Roguelike Deck building Strategy Game.
 This one is my third and most likely last attempt at making the game I envisioned for so long.
 Currently released as aplha version with 3 Classes (one being WIP), 88 total Cards, 47 Items, 16 Enemies & many more.
 Game mostly lacks in polish/visuals, since focus was mostly on mechanics/script. Will continue to work on it in spare time.

 All Code written by myslef. Majorty of assets made by myself (I'm no artist, ik).
